> The transition of repositories from the [NIEM GitHub account](https://github.com/NIEM) to the new [niemopen GitHub account](https://github.com/niemopen) is in progress.  Links to the original NIEM repos have been temporarily provided while content, open issues, and wiki pages are still being contributed.
